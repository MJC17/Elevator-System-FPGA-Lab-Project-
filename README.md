# Elevator-System-FPGA-Lab-Project-
 In the SMRTTECH 3DE3: Digital Electronics course, I collaborated with Rodney Mbaguta to design and implement a 3-level elevator system using HDL Verilog and the TerasIC DE0-Nano FPGA board. The project involved controlling a DC motor, managing a 7-segment display, and integrating push buttons and reed switches for floor control.
